## The Environment
In Scouts, it is important to take care of the environment we use. Many times, we use Leave No Trace Principles when we participate in activities. It is also important to consider the **environmental code**.

The "Environmental Code" is the consideration of being more environmentally friendly in an outdoor activity. Examples include using non-renewable energy sources, using less energy and more natural light, use less harmful resources (less toxic items), considering the potential effect from outdoor activities on the environment, and using the green bin and recycling bin more (food goes in the green bin then the garbage)

There can be long lasting effects and consequences from outdoor activities on the environment, such as air pollution (e.g. carbon dioxide from cars, snowmobiles), water (microorganisms in the water), ground water (microorganisms in the water), coastal areas (microorganisms killing aquatic animals), and land (erosion).

Protecting our environment from air pollution (e.g. emissions from cars) and water pollution (protection of streams) have long term benefits. Protecting kettly lakes like Lake Wilcox reduces the erosion and flooding. It also allows for the water in lake Ontario to be more filtered before we drink it.

## Natural Habitat
When Markham was developed, the city started by protecting natural features like kettle lakes and headwaters. They also protect the Don, Rouge, and Humber River systems and a bit of the Oak Ridges Moraine. Since the environment diversity in species, the municipality tries to preserve these species. There are many parks because the town wants to preserve these species. The Town also removed threats like the Giant Hogweed. These parks are opened to the public for hiking, walking, and even cycling.

### Invasive Creatures
York Region has an issue with the Emerald Ash Borer. This beetle is not from Canada, but from Eastern Asia. This beetle feeds on all species of Ash trees and is able to wipe out all of the Ash trees in York Region. This problem can be solved by killing all the Ash trees, to prevent the Emerald Ash Borer from eating it. As well, we could find a special pesticide that will kill them.

There are practical things we can do:
* For camps, we avoid bringing wood from different areas to avoid the spread of these creatures over a long distance.

### Climate vs. Weather
Weather is the atmospheric condition that includes the temperature, wind, precipitation, atmospheric pressure, and humidity in a particular location over a short period of time.
Climate: The average of weather in a region over a long period of time.

Climate is based on trends over many years, while weather is a day-to-day basis. You cannot predict when it will happen
Cannot predict weather, can predict climate
Climate determines the ecosystem

### Terms
Temperature
A measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in the air (measured in ºC)
Condition
Sunny, Partially cloudy, Overcast, Fog
Precipitation
Refers to both the type (rain, snow, hail, sleet, freezing rain, etc.) and quantity (measured in cm or mm)

Wind: A measure of the velocity of the particles in the air(speed and direction, measured in km/h)
Air Pressure
A measure of the force exerted, per unit area, on
the surface by the weight of the air above that surface (measured in kPa)standard pressure is 101.3 kPa (1Pa=1N/m2)
Relative Air Humidity
A measure of the amount of water vapour in the air(measured as a percentage)

Meteorologist: A meteorologists gather information on weather from various locations around the world (both current and historical) and use this information to forecast (i.e. predict) the weather for specific areas	

Causes of Weather: Interactions between the air, water, and the energy from the sun. An example of this is the equator. It is the hottest part of the world, as the sun’s rays are directly concentrated there.

### Factors Affecting Climate
LOWERN (Latitude, Ocean Current, Wind Current, Elevation, Relief, and Near Large Body of Water)

Sun's influence on Earth Climate System
Types of Radiation:
Ultraviolet Light: Invisible, short wavelengths, high energy radiation
Visible Light-390-700 nm
Infrared Light: Invisible long wavelength, low energy radiation

When radiation contacts a particle:
The radiation may be absorbed by the particle, causing the particle to gain energy
The radiation may be transmitted through the particle
The radiation may be reflected off the particle
Earth’s Energy Budget
Reflection
6% is reflected by the atmosphere
20% is reflected by the clouds
4% is reflected by the earth’s surface
Absorption
16% is absorbed by the the atmosphere
3% is absorbed by the clouds
51% is absorbed by the land and oceans
Radiation
64% is radiated back to space from the clouds and atmosphere
6% is directly radiated back to space from earth
Maintaining Balance
Energy is absorbed (70%) and reflected (30%)
Energy absorbed is converted to thermal energy(the energy present in the motion of particles)
Global temperature rises and the Earth’s surface emits mostly low-energy infrared radiation
One of the key aspects of our atmosphere that makes Earth habitable is the constant global temperature (does not change by much)

Balance of Energy on Earth
The energy the Earth absorbs is the same as the amount it radiates (keeping a constant global temperature).  
The amount of energy radiated by earth’s system equals the amount of energy earth’s system absorbs

Latitude and Climate Zones
Energy from the sun is more intense near the equator since it hits the surface directly.
Energy from the sun is less intense near the poles since the sun’s rays hit the earth’s surface at an angle and spread over a larger surface area
Climate Zone: Regions of the world that are categorized by temperature, precipitation, and plant communities. 

Ozone in the Stratosphere/Troposphere
Ozone has a Protective role in the stratosphere (upper atmosphere). In the stratosphere, ozone absorbs high energy UV radiation from the Sun, preventing it from reaching the Earth’s surface. The stratosphere protects human health (cancers), animals, and plants. High concentrations protect Earth’s surface from UV radiation from the sun. CFCs deplete the ozone layer by destroying the ozone bonds. Each CFC can destroy thousands of ozone molecules. As a result, an ozone hole is formed. 
On the contrary, Ozone has a toxic/corrosive effect in the lower troposphere. Car exhaust and the sun’s UV radiation produce toxic chemicals and ozone gas at ground levels. The mixture of gases and particles is called photochemical smog. This is harmful to human health, damages buildings, and affects animals and plants. Ozone being released into the troposphere does not move up to the stratosphere and provides no significant UV protection. 

Water Cycle

Energy is absorbed when water evaporates from oceans and lakes. The effect of cooling is experience is experienced in its surroundings.  Energy is released when water vapour condense into clouds in the atmosphere. This energy release warms the surroundings and transfers energy from one place to another.

Large Bodies of Water and Climate
Water absorbs and stores more thermal energy than land. Water heats up and cools down more slowly than land. Regions near an ocean or a large lake tend to be cooler in summer than inland locations, because it takes longer for water to warm up as it absorbs thermal energy. Additionally, they are warmer in fall as water slowly emits stored thermal energy. Regions that are downwind (direction in which wind blows) from a large body of water have more snowfall in winter. If water is not ice, air passing over the water can absorb water vapour and once it reaches the colder land, the water vapour condense into snow.

Land Formation and Climate
Mountains and other land formations affect how air moves over an area. Clouds that are blown upwards over a mountain lose their moisture as rainfall on the windward side. The leeward side of the mountain experiences little rain. This is known as the rain shadow effect.
At higher altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower because there is less air above pushing down. Air from lower altitudes rises to high altitudes then expands and cools down. At high altitudes such as mountains, air is cooler than low altitudes. This is known as “alpine climate” and it has a strong effect on the ecosystems.

Energy Transfer on the Earth (Atmosphere and Oceans)
Near the equator, the Sun’s rays reach the Earth surface with the greatest intensity. Air at the equator heats up and becomes less dense. Colder, more dense air drops, pushing the warm air into the atmosphere. Warm air moves up creating an area of low pressure below it. Once the warm air is high in the troposphere, it spreads towards the poles and cools down. The cooler air sinks back to the Earth’s surface resulting in an area of high pressure.

Water travelling towards the poles get colder. It also becomes more salty as surface water evaporates and sea ice forms. Sea ice is mostly fresh water, as it rejects the salt and freezes. The remaining water is saltier. Both the low temperature and saltiness of the water makes the water at the poles more dense and thus, the water sinks to the ocean floor. Warmer surface water from the equator flows towards the poles in the process, thermohaline circulation. Slowly moves water and the thermal energy it carries from the equator to the poles. Winds can also transport warm water to other regions.

Prevailing winds. They pass over the ocean and pick up water vapour. When the wind reaches ;amds, the water vapour condense and bring rain. Regions with prevailing winds passing over water before reaching land have a higher amount of precipitation. Wind coming from the North Pole will be drier and cold may influence the region that the prevailing wind is over.

Convection Currents vs. Thermohaline Circulation
Convection Currents
Movement of warm and cold air/other fluids creates a circular current
Thermohaline Circulation
Ocean circulation is driven by density differences created by surface heat and freshwater fluxes
Includes all ocean currents caused by changes in temperature and salinity
“Ocean Conveyor Belt”


Greenhouse Effect
Greenhouse Effect (natural process): Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb infrared radiation that is re-emitted by the surface of the Earth, after being absorbed from the sun’s radiation. The trapped IR radiation is radiated in all directions (Eventually it escapes to outer space)
“Blanket” effect: The warming of the surface resulting from the presence of an atmosphere. A natural occurrence for any planet with an atmosphere676

Greenhouse Gases  
Greenhouse Gases: These are gases that are found in the atmosphere in very low concentrations and cause the greenhouse effect. The atoms in these gases can absorb infrared energy by vibrating and re-radiate the energy.

Feedback Loops
A feedback loop is a process in which the result acts to influence the original process. There are two kinds of this; Positive and Negative Feedback Loops. For a positive feedback loop, the effect is increases the original cause. For a negative feedback loop, the effect decreases the original cause. Things can be both positive and negative feedback loops.

Albedo Effect
The Sun’s radiation is reflected on different surfaces. The Albedo is the measure of the percentage of light that an object reflects. Things with a higher albedo include ice and snow reflect more radiation. You can notice this when you are outside in a sunny winter day. The snow reflects the sun’s energy causing you to squint. Things with a lower albedo include grass and trees. The Albedo effect is a positive feedback loop about the Earth’s ice.

Long-Term and Short-Term Changes in Climate
The “Global Climate” has changed naturally over the history of the Earth. While several factors can be blamed for this, the factors that are responsible for Earth’s climate change can be divided into:
Long Term Factors: Longer term factors take tens of thousands to millions of years to occur. This also means that they are unlikely to see it in our lifetime. 
Short Term Factors: Short term factors take tens to hundreds of years to occur and occur on a short enough time frame so we can track them.

Long Term Factors
Continental Drift
Movement of land masses across face of Earth
Continents move to different position, the wind patterns and ocean currents drastically affect climate
Climate Cycles
Earth has experienced intense coolings (Ice Ages)
Ice sheets advance over continental mass and average temperature drops
Cold periods (glacials) and warmer periods (interglacials)
Eccentricity-Shape of Earth’s orbit changes from very elliptical to almost circular over 100 000 years. We are currently in a low eccentricity period (Circular)
Tilt of the Earth’s Axis (23.5 degrees)-The Earth’s axis is tilted away from the vertical. The tilt changes from 22.1 to 25.5 over a period of 41 000 years. As the angle increases, the seasonal difference increases
Precession-The Earth wobbles on its axis and this happens over 26 000 years
Milankovitch Cycle: These cycles cause 100 000 years fluctuation in global climate

Short Term
Volcanic Eruptions-Send millions of cubic meters of dust, ash, and sulfur into atmosphere. These can spread
Changes in Ocean Circulation-Changes in ocean circulation will affect the transport of energy around the world. At the end of the last glacial period, millions of cubic tons of fresh water flowed into the oceans. This disrupted the Atlantic currents, causing a brief cooling period of about 12 000 years.
El Nino-Every 2 to 7 years, the warm current that flows from South America to Australia reverses and flows the other way. This can cause a major disruption in climate with more rain in dry areas and droughts in wet areas

Proxy Evidence of Past Climates
A proxy evidence is using other data that must be obtained indirect measures of climate. They are available in regular deposits of materials found in nature.

Evidence of a Changing Climate
Rising Temperatures-In the past hundred years, the temperature has continued to rise (The average global temperature)
Melting glaciers, ice sheets, and sea ice-Ice sheets are melting. The Arctic could be ice free in summers within a few years. 
Sea Levels Rising-More floods, caused by melting ice and thermal expansion of water
Changes in Severe Weather-More intense heat waves and stronger hurricanes
Changing Seasons-Shorter winters, less severe cold days
Changed Ecosystems: Plants bloom earlier in spring, breed earlier, migration of animals, and pest change
Computer Modelling-The difference between what would natural happen and what we have done, the computer simulations show that we have definitely influenced the process over the past 50 years

Action
Using the information in the Background Section, action to address certain issues can be done. Below are some simple actions that we can do to be environmentally conscious:
“Reduce, Reuse, Recycle”
Reuse is the best. By using something a few times it is good
Paper is good to recycle 
Plastics are not generally good to have and are hard to recycle
Heavy duty plastics can be 
Things should ideally be recycled if possible than go into garbage
Recycle properly!
Garbage
This should be the final destination
Make sure there is no litter on the ground (goes in the wrong places)
Other Initiatives
Bike/Walk more to places (less driving, less carbon pollution in air)
Turn off tap when done, not too long showers
Turn off electricity (conservation)
Carpooling

Actions on an individual and society level are key.
