## Campfire Tradition
There are great songs, skits, and cheers in a group campfire - though they vary depending on the group. It is a time where everyone comes together at a camp and bring the camping spirit.

It is typically done on the Saturday night on a weekend camp.

### The Beginning of a Campfire
Campfire generally starts with the song, "Fire's Burning". a campfire. The song is typically repeated until everyone is present at the campfire.

```
Fire's burning,
Fire's burning,
Draw nearer,
Draw nearer,
In the glowing,
In the glowing
Let's sing
And be merry!
```

### More Traditions
Pouring ashes into the fire and picking it up the next day is a tradition that people do. This is to remember the campfires you've been to.
