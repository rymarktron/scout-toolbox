## Command and Marching
Used in official events and general meetings. This helps keeps groups unified.

## Formations
Formations are essential in gathering the Scouts together. They are useful in bringing order in a large group and communicating important information. For instance, at an event, one may ask their group to fall in using a horseshoe formation. After the blow of a whistle, people can fall in

There are a few formations that we typically use:
* Open Square Formation: Stand in a square in patrols
* Horseshoe Formation: Scouts stand in a horseshoe formation. The opening is where the Scout Leader stands
Line Formation: Scouts stand in line past the leaders arms. This is a fast way to get a small group together and do marching after,

Positions
1. At-Ease Position
Move the left foot to the left and put arms behind the body. This is supposed to be a relaxed position.

2. Alert Position
Stand up straight and put arms to the side. Life your leg when you are told to.

3. Marching
Follows a sequential order of left and right leg. When the left leg goes forward, your right arm goes in front. When the right leg goes forward, your right arm goes in the back.

Opening Structure
In the opening, you make sure the Scouts have their uniform tidy, share important announcements and the meeting plan.

Command: Scouts fall in! 10, 9, 8, ..., 1

Uniform Inspection
Command: Patrol leaders, can you do the uniform inspection?

Breaking of Group Flag
Command: Person A can you do the flag break

Scout Law & Promise
Command: Person A can you say the Scout Law and promise? (person A does Scout sign, everyone follows and repeat line by line)

Announcement
Command: Say what you want.

Commands should be spoken confidently, clearly, and at an auditable volume. 


Advancement Ceremony

How to fold the Canadian flag?
Fold the flag in three, length-wise
Fold in half, width-wise, where the end doesn’t touch the end exactly
Do a fan fold half way, then roll
Tie the rope on the flag pole to the rolled flag, using a double slipknot

Flag Order
The flags in the middle positions have highest priority. Go from left to right outwards after.

Canadian Flag: The Canadian flag has two congruent red rectangles on the ends and a white square in the middle. In that white square is a 11-pointed red maple leaf.

The World Scout Flag has a purple background and a white design. In the middle there is the scout sign and on the outside is a rope with a reef knot.
