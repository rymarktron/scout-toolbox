## List of Games

* String with cup activity
* Tie a few one-meter long pieces of string to a rubber band (only using one end of the string). Have a team of a few people holding each string. They can expand or contract the rubber band by pulling or loosening their grip. The goal is to bring a cup from one side to another.
---
* Tarp Activity
* You have a tarp and you cannot go outside the tarp. Have 8-10 people stand on the tarp. Try to flip it.
---
* Elephant Ball
* Scouts form a circle with their legs extended -- shoulder-length. They try to hit the ball through people’s legs. Their arms are connected like a bat.
---
* Scavenger Hunt
* Generally fun. Place bins all over the place. You can give a section map and ask them to use a compass to travel between points.

One good idea is to have gifts in each of the points in boxes for the youth.

* A series of events (usually physical) that Scouts complete. It usually is done relay style where one person goes after another.

* Activities that involve science, technology, engineering, or math. These vary greatly and highlighting the concept is important, as well as making the activity fun.

* Blind Fold Activity
* Travel to places, complete simple actions, all the while blindfolded. There is also someone who gives instructions.

### Competitive vs Non-competitive Game
Best to find a balance.


## Logic Games
These games are great indoors at a table. They are “never-can-tell” games where you are not supposed to tell someone the rules unless they figure it out.

---
* Bang Bang Bang
* Say “Bang” for each shot. You can ask, “Who’s dead?” not every round.
Secret: Whoever speaks first after the shooting stops is dead, even if they weren’t shot. If the speaker speaks first, they die.

---
* Black Magic
* Person using black magic
---
* Cross-Uncross
* You will need two sticks. Have everyone seated in a circle with chairs. Pass the sticks to your next door neighbour. I pass these sticks crossed or uncrossed. You say right or not.
Secret: When you cross your feet, they are crossed. Uncrossed would be straight legs in front.
---
* Game of likes and dislikes.
* “I like noodles but not nuts” This continues.
Secret: All likes have double letters in them
---
* I Like
* Game of likes and dislikes. “I like noodles but not nuts” This continues.
Secret: All likes have double letters in them
---
* Polar Bear Around the Ice Hole
* “Polar bears around an ice hole, like petals around a rose, is a game that is in the name, and the name is in the game. How many polar bears are there?”
1,3,5 all have a dot in the center. All you need to do is count the number of dots around the center dot. 3 = 2 polar bears/petals; 5 = 4 polar bears/pedals
