To do my duties to God and the Queen,
To help others at all times,
And to carry out the Spirit of the Scout Law

Helpful and Trustworthy,
Kind and Cheerful,
Considerate and Clean,
Wise in the Use of all Resources

Scout Sign â†’ On the right hand
This is a sign of respect and friendship. 

Examples of the Scout Promise and Law being practiced in everyday life: 
Do your best at all times (e.g. in school projects)
Help people if they need help (e.g. at school, home, or even Scouts)
Keep your word (trustworthy)
Cheer on others (e.g. in sports event) 
Clean up (Example: when the floor is dirty)
I am considerate to the environment and use the "leave no trace" philosophy.
