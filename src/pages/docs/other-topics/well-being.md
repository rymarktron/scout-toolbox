Drugs
Drugs and their effects (in health class). Also I had a discussion with my family. We talked about the biggest problems for each drug.
For alcohol the effects were nausea, vomiting, memory loss, anxiety, increased chance of cancer, high blood pressure, liver failure, osteoporosis, depression, and addiction.
For tobacco the effects included, headaches, dizziness, depression, damaged teeth, bad breath, high blood pressure, and addiction.
For Marijuana the effects included a higher chance of getting viruses, more difficulty learning, drowsiness, less physical coordination, mood changes and addiction.
For cocaine the effects include sexual problems, confusion, depression, heart attacks, hallucinations, liver problems, kidney problems, lung problems, and addiction.
Addiction can lead to financial problems (like alcoholism).

Peer pressure affects a lot. Some ways peer pressure affects people are their fashion choices, alcohol and drug use, decision to have a boyfriend or girlfriend, choice of who your friends are, academic performance, and your future. Peer pressure affects me by making my behaviour change in my environment.
Goal setting is very important because goal setting can keep you up on your feet instead of tumbling and figuring what to do next

Public Health Measures
Public health measures are there to keep the public safe from microorganisms (including viruses) and keep the public healthy. They can keep the public safe by quarantine of those who are ill so the disease does not spread.
For water treatment they filter the water, use disinfectants, and other chemicals. This reduces the amount of microorganisms in the freshwater and makes our water safe for use and clean for drinking.
For immunization they create vaccines and give them for people to lower the chance of people getting a disease.

If you have STD, you should go to the doctor. Note that symptoms aren't easily noticed. STD is in most cases curable, but others may involve stronger treatments. If you have it, make sure your partner's know about it. STD is preventable like using a condom. STD could lead to infertility if left untreated.

Dating is when two people meet for companionship. This is when two people assess whether they want to take it on another level and maybe get engaged or even married. Dating used to be where your parents chose who you married. In the 1700's, woman some equal rights than men and parents didn't have that much say. Dating throughout the world varies from variables like age, country, and gender. Now there are cases where people marry people with the same gender. Relationships normally spring from a date. Dates can come from online dating websites, speed dating, holiday, and from work (coworkers). The main aspect of dating is love. Love is scary, anxiety, and commitment, but both partners have to work together to have it.

Personal grooming habits include taking showers (and baths), brushing your teeth daily, washing your hands, changing clothes, and washing your hair with shampoo or conditioner.

Some public health things include AIDS and contagious diseases.

AIDS is the most serious and advanced stage of HIV. AIDS can only spread from body fluids such as blood, semen, pre-seminal fluids, vaginal fluids, rectal fluids, and breast milk. 
Common symptoms are headaches, fever, and rash

Two issues of public safety and security are public facility safety and safety inspectors. Two public safety and health issues are safety inspectors and swarming.
Safety inspectors' role are to keep places safe by looking for hazards which could cause injuries or even death. Safety inspectors use the five-W's (Who, what, where, when, why, and how) to examine possible threatening things or things which in the future can cause damages. Swarming is normally a huge problem in summer and spring.
