## Healthy Eating 
A good practice in general for 
baance


### Allergies and other concerns
An important part of any camp. This is especially relevant as many activities are physical and you will need a lot of energy. Be mindful of people‚Äôs allergies when planning a trip and any dietary restrictions (e.g. lactose in tolerance).

Diets are also worth understanding for different people.

Some of my favourite summer canoe trip dishes are:
Green curry with rice and vegetables (use green curry paste)
Quesadilla with vegetables
Pasta with Tomato Sauce + Season Packs
Miso soup + vegetables

Breakfast
Eggs, bacon, cereal with almond milk, pancakes, and oatmeal

Snacks:
Granola Bars
Trail Mix (make your own)

For a mobile summer camp, you can have frozen items and meats on the first day. After, it will no longer stay fresh, as there is no refrigeration.

Transport Notes:
Having protection for eggs
Use ziploc bags for foods

Fresh/frozen ‚Üí (protein) ‚Üí dry (backcountry trips)

Different Pots Sizes: The ones which stack are cool. 
Non-stick pan - good for cooking, no need for oil

Using charcoal from fire for cooking. You can put food on charcoal and bury it to ensure even cooking. This is good for family camps and younger section camps. You can put cooked vegetables inside and cooked meats. After, put some seasoning and you are all good.

Dutchoven. Place food inside the pot. After, have the charcoals on the top of the oven. You can stack them so the heat is more conserved or given to the other pots.

Swedish Fire/Canadian Candle. Big log, two perpendicular cuts. Burn in the middle. Great stove as pots can easily go on top.

## Hygiene

### Washing your Hands
Wash your hands before preparing food and after.

A good video on how to [wash your hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJfsyhQ0oBs).

### Food Hygiene
Use salts for vegetables if you can; wash food and cooking equipment

Food should be in ziploc bags and kept in the refrigerator if needed.

### Cooking

Cleaning
For cooking equipment, it is necessary to wash them and let them dry for the next use. You use detergent to wash it off. Some cooking equipment like the special cooking pots can't use detergent but simply water. 
For our mobile camping trips and car camps, we usually have a system of three containers for the cleaning station: hot water with soap, cool water with bleach, and water. 

Fire extinguisher is a must for safety. If you are using a table, place it on the other end (away from the stove) and usually on the floor, so it is easy to pick up. Make sure it is easily identifiable in the case of an emergency.
