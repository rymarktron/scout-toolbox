## General Equipment 

### Tents
There are three main components in a tent:
Groundsheet
Significance: This is usually set up so the bottom of the tent doesn’t get wet and keeps the tent clean. This is not always needed if the situation is more dry.
Instruction for Setup: Place on the ground; make sure there is enough groundsheet that it covers the entire bottom of the tent. It should also not go past the bottom of the tent.
Notes: Set up on flat area, remove obstacles like rocks before placement
The Tent
Significance: This is the structure for a tent. 
Instructions for Setup: Place on top of ground sheet. Open the poles and attach to the tent with the ends of the poles going on the corners of the tent.
Notes
Keep the tent closed when you aren’t entering or exiting, so the bugs don’t enter. 
Pegs: Put pegs in the four corners. Make sure they are noticeable and buried so they don’t pose a tripping hazard. Put them in 45 degrees from the vertical relative to the ground. Use your foot to press. If you thick there is a rock as it is difficult to put, more the tent peg further back
If it is windy, you can put more tent pegs and add guyline wires. 
If it rains a lot, you can put all the metal poles (if they exist)
The Fly
Significance: This keeps the tent dry and protects your items from the elements. This is not needed if you know it won’t rain or for day activities.
Instructions for Setup: Place over the tent on the right side. Make sure the opening is aligned with the tent. Attach to the tent
Note: This is the outer shell (not needed if it doesn’t rain)
Use guy lines if there is heavy rain or lots of wind (and more pegs)



Taking Down a Tent
Remove the tent pegs. You will work outwards
Take off the fly and shake off any water. Fold it lengthwise two times then width wise two times. Further folds may be required.
Take off the poles for the tent and fold them up. After, you can fold the tent similar to the fly. Keep the zippers a little open so the air can escape when you press on it later. When folding the tent, there may be a significant amount of air in the later folds. You can put the tent on the ground and lie on it so the air escapes. As well, you can tuck in any part of the tent that sticks out. After, put the folded up tent over the square-folded fly.
Fold the groundsheet similar to step 3
Roll up at the end. Put the tent and groundsheet slightly past the start of the fly when rolling.
If there is rain, put the wet fly in a garbage bag (consideration). Dry it later

Types of Tents 
Canvas - Primarily for winter; fewer components
Regular - Seasonal qualities; For winter, there are more poles to give a sturdier
Summer - More open areas with mesh for breathability
Mobile - Much lighter weight, thinner poles, usually for 1-2 people, more collapsable 

Make sure the zipper for the tents are closed

Grey Waters
This is water that was used for non-drinking purposes. Some examples include, water used for cooking, water used for cleaning dishes, and food residues. Treating grey waters properly is important to prevent the contamination of the environment. Also, don’t want to track: soil, water, and air. Additionally, this is a part of the Leave No Trace principles. Some steps include:
Go to the bushes with a bag and your grey waters
When you dump it, you need a bag with leaves that you will pour the residues in and poke holes in the bag to let the good water go into the ground. Any harmful particulates will be stuck in the bag and will be dumped later
Leave the bag there to sit for a while until all the residues are gone

At more established camps, you can go to the washroom to do your business or portalets.

To go to the washroom at an outdoors camp, you could do:
Number One: Behind a tree trunk/bush away from a campsite/others. Cover with leaves
Number Two: Dig a hole, do number 2, then cover the hole back with soil. You could also go to a porta potty, treasure chest (wooden box with hole at backcountry campsites), or a washroom.

Waste a hundred feet from water source.

Wood
Park wood. Can buy a set of wood from the park. Do not want to bring invasive species. Some parks they do not want you taking wood from the campground so buying wood from park is needed.

Water
You should choose wisely your source of water carefully. For short camping trips, try to bring and drink water from your home or from another filtered water source. In unpreferred conditions, you can use well water, fast-flowing water, or water from deep areas. Only use purified water for drinking uses. 

The easiest way one can ensure safe drinking water by boiling it which is recommended. Other ways include using chlorine, iodine, and a water filter, but they aren't as good due to the amount of work needed and the satisfaction. When boiling make sure your water isn't cloudy. After the water is filtered, it can be boiled. 

When going on any outdoor outing, bringing water is important. For a day hike, 2L of water (two water bottles) is best. For short 2-hour excursions, a water bottle is good.

Longer trips, a water filter is needed.

Clothing
Dressing for the weather is very important. Issues like hypothermia, frostbite, and other issues arise when people aren’t dressed properly.

Cotton vs Polyester
Cotton absorbs moisture (including water). This can be problematic, especially in cold weather where the water may freeze
Acrylic - not as good as polyester, a plastic though
Polyester is the reverse where it absorbs much less moisture
*Wool and Fleece are good substitutes for polyester and have a similar effect.
Dress in Layers: First layer is the thermal layer. If you are feeling too warm, take off a layer.

How to stay warm
Clothing
Layer principle
Avoid certain clothing
Extra clothing

Hot water bags
Keep it on the bottom of hot water bag
Pour it well, slowly
Make sure hot water bag is in place that cannot be stepped 
Fold sleeping bag to conserve heat

Pillow - clothes can be part or put clothes

Leave No Trace
The Leave No Trace philosophy can be broken in up to seven principles:
Dispose waste properly
Leave what you find
Respect wildlife
Choose a good camping site (e.g. Not marshy areas for tents)
Think ahead and prepare
Be considerate to others
Minimize campfire impacts
In effect, you want to leave the environment you are visiting in the same or better place it was when you originally came there. This is an ethical consideration and should apply every time you go somewhere.

Types of Camps:
Car Camping (staying at the same campsite)
Family Camp
Group Camps / Events
Jamborees
Backcountry Camping
*These are further expanded on later in the handbook

Emergency Plan
Most of the time, the Scouters drive their cars to the camp and have them parked nearby. In an emergency, the youth and Scouters can meet at the car and leave if needed. For remote injuries, make it as quick to the car to get help or find a park warden.

In any emergency, a head count is important to make sure no one is missing.

Expected risks and hazards at camp:
Possible wildlife encounters - avoid being close to them, have first aid kit with a Scouter at all times
Fire (indoors or outdoors) - have youth know the exits for an indoor place and set up a meeting area. For outdoor place, meet at car and leave
First aid emergency - have a Scouter bring the injured person to the nearest hospital for a major injury. For minor injuries, use a first aid kit.

Picking a Camping Site
This is a hard decision. To begin, if it is a car camping camp (where a group stays at one site for the duration of the trip), it will depend on the number of people.

When choosing how to use the space, reference to this diagram. Some activities need to be spaced further apart.

Night Time
When it is getting dark outside, ask the youth to get their flashlights and headlamps. Headlamps are also great as they don’t need to be held allowing for your hand to be used for something else besides holding it. Also, it is important to do a headcount at night (and in general) to make sure all the youth are in attendance. 

Make sure there are lights around the campgrounds to make sure people don’t trip on hazards. As well, make sure there are few tripping hazards. You may need to move some tree logs and put tent pegs further in the ground.

Hygiene
Wash hair (if possible), put cream and moisturizer on skin
Clean your teeth from brushing, rinse with mouthwash, and flossing 
Sleep at least 6-8 hours
Bring personal medication (e.g. epipen, benadryl)


Backpack Inspection
This is a strong recommendation before any Scout camp, especially with new youth. Have the youth bring their camping backpack and see if they have the important tools. It will also ensure that they do not pack last minute where they might forget critical items (E.g. wool socks).

Charcoal
This can be bought in a bag
Charcoal is burnt wood
Ash is dust - can’t be ignited

Barbecue
Turn on when used. 
Make sure someone is always at the barbecue when it is on.
Use it outside in well-ventilated area
Keep combustible idems away from barbecue and barbecue is on even surface
Ignite barbeque using an igniter with a long pipe (so it is away
Turn off gas then re-light.
Use low temperature then go up
Care by cleaning the metal before use. Also use a brush to make sure scraps are off
At end, shut off gas valve and let gas burn off

Make sure there are lights

Types of Fire Classes
Class A - Ordinary Combustibles (Wood, paper, trash)
Water is good. Foam and wet chemicals are better.
Class B - Flammable Liquids/Gases (Oils, gas)
Foam, CO2, and dry chemical powder
No water
Class C - Electrical Equiment Fires
Dry chemical powder, CO2
Class D - Combustible Metals and Alloys (very rare)
Dry chemical powder, CO2 
Class K - Fires involving commercial cooking oil appliances (cooking oils, fats, grease)
Put a lid for pot usually solves it

Fire sprinklers, hose system, fire extinguishers, fire exits, fire alarms, fire extinguishers

Class K is speciallized. Must be used after the kitchen appliance is shut off. Very specific training

Smoke Detectors/Alarms - if it is clouded (usually by smoke), make sure batteries are good

Keep well back from fire. Use PASS
Pull pin
Aim extinguisher to bass of fire
Squeeze handle
Sweep side to side

## Poisonous Plants
Poisonous plants in Ontario are poison ivy, Canada moonseed, and poison sumac. First aid for poison ivy: Wash skin thoroughly with water right away. After you remove all clothing (change your clothing). Finally contact a medical professional. 

7b) If you`ve been stung or even bitten you should scrape out the stinger/insect then put an ice pack. To prevent insect bites/stings avoid wearing bright colours and wear things that cover your entire body inside out. If you have an allergic reaction contact 911 right away.


### Sunset 
Can search sunset time up online — since this is based on the rotation of the earth and should not deviate. This is the time the sun sets and is gone. The sun will slowly set 39 minutes before and after there will still be light for some time (dusk)

### Stars
Moon cycle can be found online for any given day. It is best to see stars when there is no moon, as the moon is a very bright luminous object that will light up the sky. This is also why stars are not seen during the day time as the sun is very bright.

As well, clear skies are needed. For a day with cloudy skies, it will be much more difficult to see stars as they will be blocked from view.

When there is no moon, having a flashlight around is crucial.
