## Group Equipment
Typically the group brings equipment needed. Camping equipment can be expensive and require storage space - meaning not everyone has access to these items. As well, it saves space bringing one or two items for a group rather than everyone bringing one.

### Tents, Group Shelter
For Youth/Scouters to sleep in.
This list is not exhaustive.

* Group shelter can be used for protection from weather and create common spaces.
* Stoves
* Cooking group food
* Butane containers / gas
* Fuel for stoves
* Lanterns + batteries
Light source at night, can continue activities 
Cooler + Ice
For food that needs to be refrigerated or be at cool temperatures (to prevent bacteria build up/rotting)
Rope / large
Can be used for many purposes: set up emergency shelter, bag
First Aid Kit
Used for first aid injuries. This is usually with afterbite + tick remover.
Pots/Pans
Used for cooking food on stoves
Big utensils
Easier to share food safely
Paper towels

Saws/Axes
Cut wood. Most youth do not have these tools
Emergency shelter

The above list is important for the group to have. They are larger, commonly shared items not in the personal backpacking list.
