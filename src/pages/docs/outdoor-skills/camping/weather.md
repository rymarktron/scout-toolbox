## Weather
Be prepared. Anything can happen all the sudden. If you don’t feel comfortable doing something (e.g. canoeing through a rapid), don’t do it. 

Clouds: Certain colours and types of clouds will tell if it will rain soon. The lower atmosphere clouds are the ones that hold rain or the massive cloud-covering kind.

Rain:
Type of clouds?
Ask yourself, what type of rain am I experiencing? Drizzle, storm?
During a program, look at the conditions
Change your program depending on the conditions
Wear rain poncho and cover bags (if applicable)
Snow:
Dress appropriately (layers)
Check the weather in advance before any trip on the day of. The weather is more representative/accurate for the first day or two.
*If the weather is extreme, go indoors immediately and plan activities inside.
