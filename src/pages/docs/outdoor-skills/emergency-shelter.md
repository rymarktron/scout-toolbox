## Emergencies
Things don’t always happen according to plan

Things you should always have include: a knife, matches or flint and steel, and rope.

Knots
Clove Hitch

Eighth Knot

This can be doubled to increase strength.
Fisherman Knot

Put two ropes on top of each other. Tie two overhand knots on the rope ends that are close to each other, one on each of the ropes. Pull them together. This can be doubled to increase strength.

### Bowline Knot

Analogy: Create a rabbit hole. The "rabbit" comes up the hole, goes around the tree from right to left, and then back down the hole. 
Taut Line Hitch
This hitch is used, because it is adjustable and secure. 

Create a P. Next, make two loops in the p, then create another p and make one loop. 


### Trucker’s Hitch
This hitch is an adjustable knot that helps keep tension in the rope. 

To create a Trucker’s hitch, pull a rope around a tree and then make a slip knot on the long side of the rope. Bring the end of the short side of the rope to the slip knot hole and enter it. Pull the rope until tight. Tie it off with two half hitch. 

### Prusik knot
To connect the tarp to the rope line, you can use the prusik knot. 

Find a short rope and do the fisherman knot to tie up the end. Put the circular rope around the rope line and put one side in the other. Perform one more loop inside the second loop. Pull and adjust.

### Siberian Hitch
If you want to tie a simple easy knot to dismantle a tall rope, this knot is the best. This knot replaces the Taut Line Hitch. 

To tie this hitch, have the rope around a tree and make a long and short end of the rope. With the short end, form a loop around your fingers. Have the rest of the short end go around the rope and then pull the rope as a loop in the hole with your two fingers. Tighten slowly. Pull the long rope to bring the knot up

### Envelope
At the holes, use a bowline to attach the rope. On the other side of the rope, use a tautline hitch.

Tent Peg: To make a tent peg, find a stick and get a knife. Whittle the stick on one side and create a notch on the other side.

### Hammock Note
To set up a Hammock, find two correct-distant trees. Look at eye-level from a tree. That is the height of the hammock. Tie the rope to the tree and attach the clip to the Hammock. Adjust the hammock until it is just right in tightness. 


Emergency Storm Shelter: In the case of an extreme emergency, open the orange bag and have people go inside . If anyone is not feeling well, they receive priority. Have the people inside put their heads in the corners to give the shelter some structure. For extra comfort, sit on your backpacks inside the storm shelter.

### Other Shelters
Rain Poncho Emergency Shelter
You can get your rain poncho with rope and attach it to trees to create a smaller shelter.
