Winter camping is very different and unique from the other seasons.

## Layering Principles
This topic is the first in this document and is the most important. The limiting factor for enjoying the outdoors is not dressing warmly. If you are cold, it is difficult to enjoy the adventure. 
- Wear a thermal layer
- Wear polyester or wool shirt/pants
- Wear windproof jacket and wool socks
*if you are warm, then you take off one layer at a time

## Shelters

When it is cold outside, why not sleep indoors. For most group winter camps, usually they book a camp and stay in a lodge. The lodge will allow youth to find a balance of indoor and outdoor activities.

### Lodge

Other things to consider:
Make sure the sections bring a sleeping bag to sleep in/on top of 
Slippers inside, avoid wet shoes. Wet shoes go on cardboard at the door
Schedule/event notes posted around the lodge so youth and scouters know where to go
Establish some meet up areas
Identify washroom, kitchen
Set rules at start: no walking in the dark without a buddy and letting a Scouter know, no running indoors


### Quinzee
A dome structure made of compact snow. This is a good opportunity for senior Troop to gain a new experience. It is also great fun to build the quinzee with the Troop.
Have the Scouts create a pile of snow. A suggestion is to have Scouts bring shovels to move the snow. Have people lie on it to compress the snow. The compact snow will have less air pockets and be able to freeze into something more durable.
Put sticks at the end of the night to be an indicator how far you dug. These sticks should be one feet long.
Bring garbage bags to cover hole for quinzee
Try to fill the mound as much as possible and then wait a night for it to freeze
Use a smaller shovel or hands to dig a hole. This should be a semi sphere interior.
Create a ventilation hole at the top, slightly slanted (around 45 degrees). This will be where CO2 escapes. Air will enter through the entrance (make the entrance smaller). CO2 is lighter than air, so it will go up.
To sleep in a quinzee, you will need a groundsheet and insulated sleeping bag. The snow on the bottom and in the quinzee will melt from the heat. As well, if you want, you can have a lantern as a heat source in the quinzee. Usually one or two people can sleep in a quinzee. It will depend on the size in the interior.

Make sure to destroy the quinzee at the end of your trip — another example of Leave No Trace.


### Canvas Tent
Our group did this twice: once in 2019 and another time in 2021.

## Fires in Winter
How to start a fire in winter:
Clear base and pack the snow
Build a base
Use dry, not moist wood (evergreen/coniferous)
Use a match, lighter, or flint to light a fire

Fire Building Materials: In snowy conditions, if there are trees around, there should be plenty of fuel. Use lichens, moss or bark as tinder to get the flame started, then add twigs and small branches (dead, not green, if possible), then gradually add larger branches. Look for birch bark and branches, which create a very hot flame.

When cooking indoors, use a stove the same way you cook at home. You may need to light it with a lighter.

## Winter Activities

Winter Fun
Skiing/snowboarding
Skating
Sledding
*wear a helmet for all the activities listed above.

## Snowshoeing
Distribute weight more so you don’t sink if there is lots of snow
Make sure boots are connected to snowshoes well
Walk at a pace and you shouldn’t fall

Snowman building / snow forts
Good and fun activity
Encourage youth to work together and find their space (in a field)
Have shovels (small and large), sandcastle moulds

## First Aid

### Hypothermia, Frostbite
Wear gloves when you are outdoors and a hat (most heat will radiate from your head; extremities such as fingers and ears are important to cover in insulation, as they are the most prone to frostbite problems and lose the most energy)
If you are too cold, go inside (Car or lodge depending on what’s available); as well, put your hands in your armpits so they can warm up slowly.
Drink water frequently (you can put your water bottle in snow, full-covered, and it won’t freeze)
As Scouters, ask the question, “Are you cold? How are you feeling?”, regularly with the youth to make sure they are okay

Wet Clothes - Take them off as soon as you can and replace them with new dry clothes. You can put them on a wood stove or another heat source to melt

### Snow Blindness
A painful, temporary (e.g. 24-hours) loss of vision from over exposure to sun's rays. This can be from the snow or water.
Snow has a high percent of light that is reflected (due to the light colour)
Simple Prevention: Wear sunglasses, stay indoors
Treatment: Stay indoors and wear sunglasses. Furthermore, keep your eyes moist by using artificial tears. Lastly, do not rub your eyes.

### Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
This is a problem in shelters, especially quinzhees. By leaving a hole at the top (30 degree angle from vertical), you will let carbon dioxide leave. Carbon dioxide is lighter and will go to the top of the building. If closed and no hole, it will continue to stay. It can easily go in the body and disrupt it from getting oxygen. There should also be an opening to let oxygen come inside the quinzhee.
Avoid: have proper ventilation
Symptoms: Dizzy, Light headed. Not enough oxygen going to body and brain
Treatment: Let person go to place with more oxygen, rest, lower body

### Falling in Ice
If you do fall in the ice, make sure you swim up as quickly as possible. Afterward, get your hands on the ice and distribute your weight. If there are any other members in your party, they should slowly lie on the ice and make their way towards you. They can help you get out of the ice by pulling you towards them. Once you are out, take off your clothes immediately. Someone should have a towel nearby.

## Canvas Tent
This camping is unique and has numerous challenges:
Since you are outdoors all-day, it is important to dress warmly (have good gloves especially and a thermal layer)
Use hardwood and preferably larger logs (as they will last longer in the night; a relatively large one can last for 30-45 minutes)

Plan in the day:
- Set up in a place protected by the wind, lots of trees 
When setting up the tent, make sure that all the parts go in the right places and fit in place. Set up the stove first then put the canvas
- Cut plenty of wood during the day and into the night and create a pile inside the canvas tent. This should be easily accessible so it can be added into the fire
Some wood should be put near the fire/placed on top of the stove so the moisture can melt (Easier to burn inside
- During the night, take turns putting in the wood. One person should be awake feeding the fire while the others sleep. Ensure that the ventilation shaft is closed or more closed so the heat stays inside the tent rather than escapes as steam

Sleds are great for putting wood in and carrying backpacks. In emergency, you could put person there

## Water Supply
Put it in a container that can be covered with snow. Water bottles can be fully buried in snow. It will insulate it and prevent it from freezing overnight and during the day.

As well, if indoors, you can boil water or make sure the water filter is good as a supply. 

When outdoors, you can boil water. If there is a stove, put some snow in a metal container and put it over the stove or near it. The snow will slowly melt around the heat source.
Going from snow/ice to liquid water (change in chemical state) requires a lot of energy - as well as time to heat up. That is why finding liquid water is best. 

Salt
It is important to put on ice if it is slippery and around. Lower melting point making it easier for it to melt and stay melted. Nowadays, we see how salt impacts our lakes so avoid using too much.
