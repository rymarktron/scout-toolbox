>> A Scout is wise in the use of all resources

This line is fundamental when looking in an environment for resources to use for building a fire, shelter, or other reasons.

It is often impractical to buy and bring everything to a campsite in advance, so preparation is key.

## Trees

### Hardwood/Softwood Trees
Hardwood burns for longer periods of time and are desirable for campfires and cooking fires. On the contrary, softwood is good and easy to cut. Be aware of the difference as it will be important for different situations.

Deciduous - softwood
Coniferous - hardwood

### Alive vs Dead Trees
Also, use dead trees, not trees that are alive. Dead trees are usually brown in colour, the interior is dark and dry, and they are not connected to roots. The biggest reason why you choose a dead tree is it is usually dry on the inside, and as a result, it burns better. For live trees, they have water to keep the tree alive which takes even more time and energy to burn; you also get smoke from the water.


A good practice in general for 
baance

The same applies for branches. If you can see green, then donâ€™t burn as it will take longer to burn (live = has water).

Do not bring wood from your home or other parks to avoid the transfer of invasive species.

## Fall Time
In the Fall, the colded temperatures and less sunlight. Plants save energy by stopping the production of Chrlophyll II and as a results, the leaves change colours and eventually fall.

Rain will result in leaves falling down at a faster rate.

In Ontario, there are two key periods:
Maples (Mid-September)
Red/orange colour
Will turn brown and fall
Birch/Tamaracks
Yellow/green colour
*Note: The exact time differs year to year. There are websites that track the colours

In this time of the year, a high upview is very nice. Most parks in Ontario will offer these nice colours.
