## Wildflowers
Wildflowers usually grow in the springtime, since the deciduous trees have not grown leaves that block sunlight to low levels of the forest.

During the winter, they disappear due to the reduction of light and hibernation from the cold.


Interestingly, cattails can be eaten 
Dandelions

Fishing ðŸŽ£ 
Patience is key for this activity. 
Notes
Live bait is best 
Look for areas with fish (should be able to see them)
Middle of pond is good (use a boat/canoe)

Set Up:
Have a little wire then throw 
Slowly loosen the wire so it can go further away from the boat
You can use a buoy at the top so fishing wire will float beyond the point of set up
When you feel a tug, pull the wire and bring it back

There are fishing laws and regulations. Be sure to look them up in the area you intend to fish.
