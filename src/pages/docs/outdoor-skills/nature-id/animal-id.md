Animals
Wildlife can be vicious, especially when they have food so stay away and do not approach them.
Bears - In Ontario, there are only black bears (In BC/AB there are grizzly bears). If you see one, make noise.

For raccoons, keep garbage in enclosed places. Red squirrels are the same. They will look cute but do not feed. As well, keep all bags closed as they will tear into bags easily.

Stay on the path or open area to avoid encountering animals. As well, avoid having food out as that is most likely to attract them. Close food bins and put them in heavy duty bags. Do not feed the wildlife.

Mosquitos and Bugs
They are attracted to heat (warm blooded animals have blood), sweat, and CO2.

They usually start to appear after Mother’s Day (they hibernate in the months before). The peak is in July, because of the extreme hot weather. They slowly die down over time as the temperature goes down. By the end of August, they mostly die down due to the colder weather. 

There are four main types of flies/mosquitoes to know:
Mosquitoes:
Identifiers: Small, pesky
Symptoms: Small, round bite (Appears immediately)
Solution: Wear long clothes, mesh if possible, DEET spray (do not apply to water resistant clothing)
Horseflies
Identifiers: Fast, loud
Symptoms: Instant, sharp bite
Blackflies
Identifiers: Larger
Deerfly
Solution: Tape on the top of hat

Bees and Wasps
Bees: Can only sting once
Wasp: Can sting multiple times

Other information:
Mosquitoes hang out and breed in water. They are out in more humid conditions - during rain/warm humid day. As well, they are attracted to heat sources. Avoid eating bananas, as you’ll release a significant quantity of CO2.

DEET
This chemical confuses and interferes with receptors on a mosquito's presence. Receptors use to detect body heat, CO2, skin chemical when seeking out prey
Avoid putting this on water resistant/proof equipment as it will damage it
Can be used for ticks

Wear long pants to avoid ticks junpibg

If it is painful, you can use afterbite.
If you exhibit more severe symptoms, call ems.

Ticks
Avoid long grass
Check your feet area
Low ground areas
