## Introduction to Hiking
One of the Most Popular Activities

### Buddy System
This is an important procedure when people break off in a group:
Let someone know what you are doing
Have a whistle (blow it loud in the case of an emergency)
If possible, carry a walkie talkie

The goal is to prevent separation. In some scenarios, there would be a person in the front and back of a group. Also the troop sometimes encourages bright jackets to be worn on outings/ have reflective tape on their jackets. During hiking trips, we might put special tape on trees so we can find our direction back. 

If you are lost then blow your whistle 3 times, stay calm, and if applicable, use your survival kit and prepare for the worst.

### Compass
There are 16 points on a compass. There are four directions: north, east, south, and west. With a park map, you’ll be able to see the location you are trying to head to. As well, look for location indicators (e.g. facilities, bodies of water).

Limitations: You only know the direction and will need map, cannot place near metal objects

Natural Compass: The sun rises from the east and sets in the west. As well, wind usually blows from the west.

To use a compass, do the following:
Make sure the compass is away any metal as it may give a direction pointing towards that metal instead
Have the compass on a flat and the compass arrow parallel to the ground

Physics Behind the Compass: The Earth has a magnetic field which also happens to protect us from the harmful solar waves. 

True North - North Pole
Magnetic North - This changes every year due to slight rotations. Need to adjust with map reading

### Line of Communication
For any hike, make sure your whole group is together. Separation creates a huge list of problems. Every few minutes, check the back of the line and make sure everyone is there. Having walkie talkies might help.

### Emergency Prevention
As well, let someone (who is not hiking with you) know where you are. Whether it’s parents or park staff, it’s good to let someone know in case you get lost. Taking a photo at the start might help people identify you if you are lost, and let people know your driving route and vehicles.

## Reading a Map

### Types of Maps
Terrain/topographic map 
each contour is around 10 m high and marks elevation difference
Road maps 
Useful for getting when driving to recognize important streets
Look for points of interest/indicators
Landmarks, such as power lines, monuments are great

### Trail junctions
If there are two trails that one can go to, it is important that you identify which one you want to go otherwise you’ll be going in the wrong direction
Find which way is North so you can position your compass that way
Try to buy a waterproof map, laminate it, or put it in a ziploc bag incase it rains or water spills on it

Maps
Laminate or ziplock bag tight

Plan hikes in fall or spring. Less hot, less bugs… a little cooler. Dress for weather

Equipment for a Day Hiking Trip
Day Backpack
Hiking Stick
Water
Compass + Map + Watch

Other Notes:
Snacks + Meal
Water (Drink lots of it)

Suggestion: After hiking, it is recommended to take a bath with epsom salt (if you have). It will relax your muscles. This can be applied to any other outing.

Activity: Orienteering with poles is a good activity to get Scouts to use their compass skills. A scavenger hunt works quite well too!

Global Positioning System (GPS) 
A satellite-based system that provides location data operated by the US government first launched in 1978
Geographers/hikers use it for navigation
A GPS works by: Orbiting satellites provide navigation data around the clock. The satellites send radio signals to Earth that a GPS unit uses to calculate its latitude and longitude
Each satellite’s signal contains the exact time it was sent
A GPS unit used this time to measure and calculate the distance of the satellite signals from at least 3 satellites (Triangulation) are needed by a GPS unit to determine its location.
 
Basic uses of GPS include: location, tracking, mapping, and timing (give precise times around the world). A GPS unit is how we can access this technology.

A waypoint is a specific location in coordinates on a GPS. On a GPS unit, you can save multiple waypoints to mark different points on a trail. When you reach those points, you will know that you are not lost.

As well, on many topography maps, there will be some coordinates on the edges of the map. By looking at the edges of the map, it will give you coordinates and their spacing. You can find your point and have two imaginary lines (one horizontal and vertical from your point of interest. Where it lies on the edges will tell you the coordinates. Afterwards, it is easy to put it on a GPS. The reverse can happen where you find a point, look for the topography point then input in GPS.

Trail Markers
The image on the left shows the trail marker signs that are common in popular trails. By following and looking for these markers regularly, you’ll always know that you are following the trail. Additionally, different trails may use different colours with some signage indicating which is which at the trailhead and sometimes junctions. 

Inukshuks are also a marker that you are following the right trail. Seeing people around you is also a good indicator that you are going in the right direction.

### Lost
Make sure to stay on the path or avoid going through the forest to avoid damaging the environment.

If you are lost, stay where you are and set up shelter, unless they know where you group is (e.g. on a one-way trail). For the younger sections, we tell them to “hug a tree” if they are lost. The result is the same effect where a tree acts as shelter. Besides, it will be easier for others to find you if you stay where you are.

### Emergency Signals and Signalling Devices
SOS - Create SOS with some trees. The bigger the better. The idea is it attracts helicopters
Flare - To fire a flare, screw it tightly onto the launcher, then pull back the firing button to rest in the notch. Snapping the button out of the notch strikes the flare with a firing pin, launching it up to 300 feet as it burns for 6.5 seconds. Best to do in water to avoid causing a forest fire
Mirrors - Hold the mirror close to your eyes. Look through aperture. Extend the other arm and with the middle finger, make a V. Place the target at top of B. Tilt the mirror so it reflects sunlight to fingers. Each time you sweep bright reflection, you send a signal flash to target
Horn - Long whistle blast

Simple Sprain
RICE Treatment: Rest, Immobilize, Cold (Use ice), Elevation
 
Blisters: They are caused by the rubbing of skin on another object. To treat a blister, do the following:
1. Wash your hands and the blister with water or another disinfectant
2. Use a disinfectant (e.g. rubbing alcohol) to clean the blister
3. Sterilize a sharp needle and use it to puncture the blister. Let the fluid drain. 
4. Add an ointment (e.g. polysporin, vaseline) on the blister
5. Cover the blister with a bandaid

### Backpacks
If you have a chance, try to go to a store with the Scout group. When choosing a backpack, consider the following:
Size
Waist strap and hip strap (necessity to distribute weight; goal is to have least amount of weight on shoulders)
Number of compartments
Some people like having a water/hydration bladder where you can drink from your water bottle using a long straw usually connected to your bag. Some bags offer it at purchase

Put the heaviest clothing at the bottom. Less accessible

Hiking Boots
Gore Tex - waterproof hiking boots. They are very helpful when backpacking, especially when there are many puddles. They only last for around a year or two when used. Will need to reseal after.
Heel Support - Extra part on the back of the boot to protect the heel. 

As well, look after your footwear by cleaning it and waterproofing it regularly. It will last longer and be more comfortable over time. Wear the right socks (neither too tight or loose), avoid cotton, sock liner. 

Weather
Dressing for the weather is very important. Issues like hypothermia, frostbite, and other issues arise when people aren’t dressed properly.

Cotton vs Polyester
Cotton absorbs moisture (including water). This can be problematic, especially in cold weather where the water may freeze
Acrylic - not as good as polyester, a plastic though
Polyester is the reverse where it absorbs much less moisture

Risks
When hiking, there may be unstable or elevated risk areas (e.g. slick trails, icy terrain). They can be avoided or completed safely. There are strategies, such as holding on trees when going down a hill and walking around an unstable area. As well, you can make a judgement call and determine if it is worth continuing on trail or finding an alternative route. These are learned from experience and the strategies will be used on a case-to-case basis.

Cross marsh/bog, wetground
In most trails, they have established boardwalks. Walk on those to avoid going in the water. Alternatively, try to walk around and take a long path; look at the map.

Cross River
Try to find where it is as narrow as possible so you do not have to travel far. Ideally go on stable large rocks and test footing before stepping and moving. Follow the river until it is shallow then cross. Alternatively, you could find a big tree and move it to go across the stream. make sure it is stable, have someone hold it on one end, and then go across.

Etiquette
Follow the path (or path markers) as much as possible to avoid disrupting the natural environment. It may damage the wildlife around and disrupt the soil leading to possible erosion. Avoid stepping on flora if possible. Avoid loud noises and leave no trace.

Stay to right of trail, pass on the left

Backpacking Trips (also known as overnight hiking trips)
These trips are fundamentally challenging, because you have to travel with all your gear from one point to another without the assistance of any motorized vehicles.

The biggest challenge is being able to travel around carrying a backpack with all your equipment and the groups. The weight makes your body tired after traveling long distances. There are some ways to reduce the weight of your backpack:
Reuse clothing (bring less clothes)
Air compressed groundsheet
Group equipment - portable stove, mini lanterns
Dehydrated food

Using a good backpack with a hip strap is especially important, as you will be travelling for hours. 

General Group Equipment
Tents  - shelter
Stoves (the small one) - used to cook food
Gas (fuel blocks) - fuel source for many equipment 
First Aid Kit - safety. equipment can deal with many injuries
Pots - for cooking 
Water Filter - filter water so it is drinkable 
3 foldable cleaning bins - hygiene
Sponges + Soap - cleaning
Tarps - easy to unfold to provide shelter
Lantern - a light/heat source at night
Saw/axe - can cut trees/big logs and used for fires
Kitchen stuff (cooking utensils) - used for cooking

Be sure to do checks and maintenance.

Hyponatremia
This is a health condition that occurs when there is low sodium in a person's blood. Dehydration is a big problem for hikers with hot environments and lots of movement resulting in sweat/perspiration. Water intoxication/overhydration can happen to solve this issue. 

This causes a sodium imbalance leading to hyponatremia. Symptoms may be dizziness and general cramp and dehydration. Try to avoid dirnking too much or have more electrolytes.

Sunscreen
There are different ratings (more effective)
If spray, spray close to skin and then pour around
Aerosols will dissipate in air and will likely not go to the intended place
Water
Consider Nalgene 1L water bottle
For warm drinks, use metal bottle but be careful

Hiking Stick
Find straight wood in woods that is approximately your height. Bring home and use the knife to peel wood and let it dry fully. You can put a laminent on it to keep its form. This can give more stability.

Types of Trails
Foot trails - flat, dirt path
Bikeway/sidewalk/road
Boardwalks - cross over water/marsh area. Usually made of wood. Walk slowly and stay on path
Multi-use trail - very large, watch out for bikers/horses
Unofficial trails - rugged, not as developed (may be poisonous flowers, ticks/animals)

Navigate at Night or Poor Visibility
Turn on flashlight, be cautious, follow trail
