### The History of Canoeing
Canoe Mobile Trips
Special Type of Trip with Unique Challenges 

Canoeing
These are the most fun adventures. There can be a number of risks: lightning, wildlife, current, getting lost; so, you take precautions.

Portage: Be sure to bring and use a pad for the yolk. It will better distribute the weight and give greater comfort. Carry as much from one side to another (usually one or two backpacks plus smaller items/bags).

When Canoeing:
Make sure boat is evenly distributed in weight from bags and people
Bags should be in water resistant bags

Basic Safety Rules in the Water
Wear a PFD that fits
Buddy System - Swim with a partner (accountability)
When you are tired, take a rest
Be in a safe, approved area
Don’t wander around
Wear sunscreen
Drink lots of fluids

In a water trip, you should wear the following:
Wear loose-fitting clothes which are comfortable
Light coloured clothing to avoid being attracted to insects
Long sleeved shirt - protection from sun
Hat (ideally cap) and sunglasses
Rain jacket (in case of inclement weather)
Bug jacket

PFD (Personal Floatation Device) → This device keeps users afloat in the water. When picking a PFD, make sure that it is a comfortable snug. If it is not comfortable, it is likely the wrong size. Moreover, it is important to buckle all the straps and zip up.

The difference between a PFD and lifejacket is the fact that a lifejacket has a head pad and a PFD doesn’t. Both work well in any water activity. Usually little kids use a lifejacket.


How to Pick the Right Paddle
Grip the paddle where your two hands are on the two ends of the shaft
Raise your arms over your head. Your arms should form a 90 degree angle with your elbows
If the arm is bent outwards, the paddle is too long. If it bends inwards, the paddle is too short.
Try different paddles until you find the right size

Distress Signal: Blow a whistle three times or one long blow if you are in trouble.

Risks involved with paddling in different weather conditions:
Lightning Storm/Heavy Rain
Tipping - waves could be too strong
Electrocution 
Hypothermia
Heat Wave
Dehydration/Heat Stroke

Three Methods to get someone to safety in the water are the following:
Wade. Get a long stick and pull them over
Throw a lifebuoy, life jacket with a rope to tow them over
If you have a boat, approach the person slowly and throw them a lifebuoy. They will approach it and let them grab onto the boat. Do not offer your hand to them, as they may grab it

### Different Positions
H.E.L.P. (Heat Escape Lessening Posture) → Use for one person
Huddle → Use when there are multiple people

J-Stroke
Canadian J-Stroke → Pull the water back, bending your thumb forward, and then push the water outwards

American J-Stroke → Pull the water back, bending your thumb back and pull water towards the boat, and then pull the water away from the boat. This is good for effectively stopping the boat between strokes.

Drawing: Drawing is used when you are trying to go towards the left or right (e.g. getting to the shore). Put the paddle in a 90 degree angle from the boat. Push the water towards the boat.
Feathering: Feathering is used when you are trying to balance the boat. Paddle outwards as if you are “spreading butter”.
Raft Up: A raft up makes it more convenient to communicate in a large group. This can be for the purpose of a headcount or to simply have lunch (share food). 

More Efficient Paddling (From Dragon Boating)
Use more of your hip to pull the paddle
Have an A-frame where you use your full extended arm
Constant paddling to keep momentum
More paddle buried in water

Map Reading
Map reading and having someone confirm your directions are essential. When we were paddling, cross-check your directions using our compass. It’s important as there can be many inlets. 

One strategy which may work is using Google Maps offline when travelling, as it gives a fairly good showing of where you are. Prior to a trip, download the offline maps on Google Maps app and you will be able to track the area you go. That is one strategy we used when navigating through the French River.

Large bays present issues. There are taller and more frequent waves oftentimes. Try to paddle closer to the shore where the waves are less strong.

## Canoe Trip Logistics

### Daily Timeline
Early Morning
Paddle early in the morning when the sun is lower. When the sun is on top of you (around noon), there will be significantly stronger waves due to the wind. Usually we start canoe trips as early as we can.
Day Time
For the most part, you are paddling to the lake you booked and looking for a campsite. For campsites, look for one that is relatively flat so you can set up your tents. When you find one you like, dock and unload your gear.
Afternoon
At around 4 pm, you should have paddled the distance you needed to travel and found a campsite. You need the daylight to set up the tents and equipment. When it is dark, it will be hard to complete tasks. 
Evening
Distribution of roles. There are a number of roles that need to be completed: fire making, cooking, water filtration, and setting up the bear bag. It is truly a team effort


A team is as weak as the weakest link. For these canoe trips, make sure everyone is okay
Teamwork is essential in a canoe trip
Everyone should be doing a part/task so the team is able to do more and be prepared for night

### Water Level
In August, there is great sun so much of the water. For some areas, especially narrow channels, the water difference will be significant — the difference of you needing to get out of your canoe and walk it, or in rare cases, lift it. As well, the streams go down, so there’s less water up the stream. 

### Lifestraw 
This is a commercial backpacking portable water treatment device. This is a backup for water. Water can disappear easily. This straw can filter water. It is recommended to have two 1-L water bottles; one for drinking clean boiled water, another for lake water. This straw will last for two years then will need to be replaced.

Advantage: does not require any energy (power source), filters contaminated water and makes it drinkable
Limitations: Can only be used by one person, cannot filter water into another container (must be used during time of drinking)

As well, it is important to have for individuals.
- Drink water from the middle of the lake (preferably with a big one). Figure out where the water comes from. Upstream?
- Sip a few times then the water will go up the tubes.
- The tubes have micro filters. After, you can blow out the water that you didn’t drink to push out bacteria
- At home, flush with water and dry to reduce mold/contaminants
Expires every three years

## Float Plan / Backcountry Emergency
The purpose of a float plan is to let someone anticipate where you are going in case something goes wrong and you are in need of search and rescue. Usually, you can tell a different Scouter not going on the trip where you are going and the Park Ranger at the park’s office. Telling them information, such as tent colours, group size, planned campsites, and most importantly, planned route. Constantly keep in contact with parents at certain checkpoints: arrival, leaving.

Call 911 if there is a cellular signal. If you know there is a cellular signal somewhere, you may need to travel there to get help. You could also use SMS which will send a location. If none of those are options, use an emergency signal. Treat the person and try to help them.

Equipment: Keep equipment in water proof/resistant bags. As well, protect your map by putting it in a protected place or buy a waterproof map.

### Portaging
Suggestion: have a yolk pad
If you can’t put it over your neck, have two people hold it
Have someone guide the canoe
Try to Scout the terrain at the start to find areas which are better to climb
Get everything off so you can have more people help bring stuff from one side to another
Oftentimes, Scouts will need to make around 3-5 trips so the distances from there and back to there add up.
At the end, put the canoe in the water first so you can put your gear

### Waterproof everything
Using garbage bags is not recommended because of the waste they create. It is also easy for the bag to form tears
Backpacks, all gear should be either covered by a water-resistant sleeve or in a waterproof bag
Maps should be either laminated or be waterproofed
Equipment can get wet from a storm or simply from paddle strokes

### Rain and Splashes
If water is in a canoe, there may be a water container/bucket to help take it out. During rain, there may be a lot of water. Alternatively, it can come from poor paddling technique where splashes lead to water entering canoe

If there is too much water, you can flip the canoe and the water will be out. This can be done at a portage site.

There is also an emergency bag in each canoe (should be there). This bag has rope and a whistle.


### Canoe Tipping
If your canoe tips/capsizes, you can do the following:
Bring your canoe to shore by swimming and pulling it (if you are close by)
Shake Out
Roll the canoe over so that it is the right side up. Go to the middle oof the canoe and slowly push and pull so the water sloshes out. Reenter the canoe by gripping the far side and pull yourself over
Capistrano Flip
If you have 2-people, have each person go on the two ends under the canoe. 
Push the canoe up while treading water to break the suction.
Shove up as hard and fast to flip the canoe
Position yourselves on both ends opposite from one another and get on simultaneously

Other Good Tips:
Park cars at the canoe dock so you save time
Keep extra water in the car for the ride there and back
Distribute weight on the canoe. Backpacks and other heavy big bags should go in the middle. After miscellaneous bags can be put in
Canoe dock at the campsite. Be mindful that the rocks don't scratch the canoe. 
Choosing a Good Site; Trees to cover from wind, large tree that could be used to hang bear bag, flat large areas for tent set up, no known hazards (e.g. poison ivy)
If there is food, it either goes in the fire, back in the food container, or is eaten. Clean up

No paddling when there is lightning. It could strike the middle of the lake. Light rain is okay. Avoid setting up tents near a large tree.

Set Up Procedures
Priorities at camp - set up shelter (put equipment inside to protect from rain), cooking
Bring canoes up and flip them so you don’t have water accumulating over night. As well, you have a table and it can stay away from falling into the shore.
Prepare campfire and bear bag

### Bear Bag
Use a small bag with rocks and tie it to one end of the string to toss. It will give the momentum to go higher
As well, keep enough rope free so it can go with the rope as the rock bag is tossed
Ask for scouts to give you their food at night. 
Once the rope is on the branch, you can slowly throw some of the rope forward so the rope bag goes down slowly to the ground from the other side of the branch
Try to set up before nightfall so you can practice swinging the rope

### Campsite
Canoes can be used as a table by flipping it and putting it on level ground on the campsite. Canoes should be brought up away from the water so it does not disappear and float away at night (Even if it is tied). 

Paddles that are wooden should be brought inside the tent so a beaver does not mistake it as wood.

Lighting a Fire when it is wet 
Find roots and under you may find dry things protected from the tree. As well, under the leaves there may be some dry branches. Big dead logs - the outer will be wet but the interior should be dry. 

If it rains, you can put the tarp over the items to avoid it getting soaked. The priority should be protecting things that cannot be wet

## Tents
Put it in a garbage bag if it gets wet. Same with other equipment, though you should put it in separate bags.

Group Equipment
- Tents
- Stoves
- Butane containers / gas
- Lanterns + batteries
- PFDs
