## Fire Skills

### Fundamentals
The Fire Triangle: All fires need fuel, oxygen, and heat. If one of them is missing, it will not light.
Matches: Strike the phosphorus strip to create flame.
Flint and Steel: Take a large strike. Apply pressure when striking. 

### Selection of Materials
Natural Fire Starters → Birch, Pine, Cedar Bark, Leaves
Unnatural Fire Starters → Cotton, Paper

#### Tinder, Kindling, and Fuel
Tinder
*Characteristics*: small, easy to light

Good tinder include:
- Stripped birch bark
- Cedar
- Dried leaves
- Cotton
- Milkweed

Kindling
Characteristics: medium sized, branches
- Twigs
- You may need to splint some wood using an axe to make it kindling

Fuel
Characteristics: large, thick
Usually use saw or axe to cut into pieces
Burn for a couple of hour

### Campfire
A campfire should begin with tinder and work its way in size. The biggest issue for most fires is not having enough twigs (tinder + kindling). Sort it in advance in three piles. Do not start lighting it unless you have enough sticks in each pile (rougly a two handfuls for both for a group fire).

As the fire is lit, you can get twigs, branches from around the area to fuel it. Logs will need to be cut regularly so the fire can last a long time.

### Fire Lighting Set Up
Find a location, dirt-only area to avoid the forest from lighting on fire
Collect some rocks to form a ring on top of the rocks (fairly big ring in order topic sticks inside)
Bring your tinder, kindling, matches, and fuelwood to the newly formed pit
In that pit, put some tinder and kindling in the beginning and ignite the match
Put it on top of the kindling and tinder and spread the flame around the tinder
Once the flame has begun, start to put the fuel wood in order to form a teepee. Later on begin to make a log cabin around it

### Fire Structures
Tepee
Make sure there is enough oxygen in the tinder and kindling in the middle.

Log Cabin - ensure that there is enough air entering.

A good strategy is light it elsewhere and put it in the fire when a sustainable flame exists later.

Always have tinder and other sticks nearby to feed the fire to sustain the flame.

Star Campfire - Have a fire in the middle. Have a few larger pieces of wood and form a star-like shape. Over time, put the wood closer to the middle 

Huntsman - two big logs in the middle, side-by-side; put tinder and sticks in the middle crack between the two logs and burn. A lot of tinder is required as the big logs take a long time to burn. As well, rotate the logs as the middle will have a hole over time 


*For larger campfires, it is usually a modified tepee fire: a log cabin in the middle followed by a larger tepee giving its shape and space for oxygen to enter.

Other Notes:
For wind, you can place rocks or use your coats to cover the wind. Find the direction of wind and react.
As well, have wood nearby so you can consistently feed the fire once it is going.
For matches, you can point a lite match down so it can get a little bit bigger. Alternatively, you can point it up for it to be smaller
There needs to be enough space for oxygen to enter. You may need to remove some sticks

Fire Tools
Feathering a stick: create little notches and scraps on a medium sized piece of wood. It is good to put in fire, more points to burn
Using cedar or birch bark by lighting a piece followed by a birds nest
Using a knife and scrapping bits from cedar or birch works well; the smaller the pieces, the easier to light

### Cooking with a Fire:
Tepee fire
With a stick in the middle, put a pot
You can add wood on the bottom for the fire to continue
Swedish Fire
Big log with the flat part on the ground. There are two axe cuts so the fire can burn in the middle
At the top, you could put a pot
Use charcoals — hot burned wood
Put pot on top; prefer the white coal not black


Bow Drill - pull and push fast fast
Little piece of tinder (cedar works great). Have something flammable nearby so it catches on fire then move to the campfire. More challenging to do but certainly possible

Extinguishing a Campfire
After having a campfire, you must safely put it out, otherwise there could be great issues if it spreads. Once all the wood in the fire burns out you need to clean up the area and leave no trace. To make sure the fire is out, put water on top. If you are not using a designated campfire spot, get the coal/ashes using wood and gloves and disperse them across the forest the next day.
