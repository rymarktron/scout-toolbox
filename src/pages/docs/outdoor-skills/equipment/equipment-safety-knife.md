## Knife

Safety first always. These tools can be weapons for the inexperienced, but useful for the skilled. It is important to have an understanding of the safety and practice before using it at camps. Experienced Scouters usually give a permit (paper/pin) acknowledging that the Scout knows how to use it and can be trusted. If the trust is violated, the permit can be taken back.

Furthermore, in the younger sections, they may be restricted from the tools in all cases (e.g. matches/knives for Beavers). Alternative safer tools such as a potato peel, plastic knife can be used in their activities. Though a little challenging to use, they can be useful in a program.
