## Why safety?
A tool can be very useful when used correctly. It can also be a danger when not used correctly.

Typically for youth these skills are learned over time during the course of their Scouting journey. In Beavers, they may only use plastic knives; Cubs use potato peelers and knives and matches under supervision; Scouts all the equipment; and Venturers and Rovers with more tools.

Trust is built over time to ensure youth know how to use the tools properly and safely.
