## A Leader
Leadership can be given to the youth. They can give ideas in the meetings. Their ideas are often unique and may make the youthâ€™s experience in Scouts more fun and worthwhile. Youth-led events are important, which is why for all the top-section awards they require some planning and action in a project. 

Troops can be encouraged by this leadership by providing them opportunities to plan-do-review, such as organizing a hike and leading younger sections in their activities.

The degree to which leadership is given will depend on the age group and their observed capabilities.
