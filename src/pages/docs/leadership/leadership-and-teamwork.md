## A Leader
A leader is someone who leads a group of people to accomplish a task. In any organization, this is a role that can be completed by anyone, but it’s often important and necessary for someone to be in the role to complete an objective. Good examples include: leading a team in a competition, organizing an event, and managing a team at work. 

It is important to recognize that little acts of leadership exist all around the world, and anyone can have leadership in the moment. It’s a dynamic role and in a good team, any member of the team can be a leader at any given moment.

As well, helping people out often is reciprocated (at some point). When someone is in the need of a helping hand, help them if it is not a barrier on your part. When you need one, you would hope someone would help.

### My Scouting Experience
From my time in Scouts, I have learned a great deal about leadership. I have been on both sides of leadership, the person leading and the person following, and I have a better understanding of what leadership means in practice. 

I’ve also learned the importance of knowing and putting trust in your team. Understanding your teammates can build trust resulting in greater accomplishments. When I was in a team of six in the French River area, we were close and able to do the tasks that we used to have 18 people do in the same camp.

Leadership in Scouts often requires one to have some skills and techniques:
Good communication (loud, clear voice)
Well prepared and knowledgeable
Have a positive attitude

To create successful change, one must be committed in their team, have clear communication, listen to others, and have a plan. 

### Teamwork
One of the most important parts of being a good leader is learning to be a good team player. Asking the question, “how can I help you?” is incredibly helpful to support other leaders. By supporting other leaders and their ideas, they often will return the favour when you need help.

### Wisdom
A good leader knows when to ask for help or advice from others. There’s a reason why we have multiple Scouters and call in some to give advice on a specific topic (e.g. Scouter Glenn for knotting activities). 

### Good Leadership 
Good leadership is remembered. An example of someone who had good leadership is Martin Luther King Jr. He was one of many protesters in the 1960s fighting for African-American civil rights. His movement convinced the United States Senate that African Americans should be treated equally and have the same rights as "white" people. He had a famous speech about having a dream of equality. King envisioned a future without racism: "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. I have a dream today!" He was considerate to both sides and spoke clearly to his followers.

### Stepping Back
When someone else is good at the task or is exhibiting leadership, let them take control of the ship. Good leadership is knowing when to step back when people are doing a good job. Why would you want to stop a team when they are doing great work?

### Youth Leadership
Leadership can be given to the youth. They can give ideas in the meetings. Their ideas are often unique and may make the youth’s experience in Scouts more fun and worthwhile. Youth-led events are important, which is why for all the top-section awards they require some planning and action in a project. 

Troops can be encouraged by this leadership by providing them opportunities to plan-do-review, such as organizing a hike and leading younger sections in their activities.

The degree to which leadership is given will depend on the age group and their observed capabilities.

### Mistakes
People can make mistakes or disappoint you for different reasons. A good leader will recognize that if the person cared about the issue and made a genuine mistake that they should not be punished. Instead, they should acknowledge it was a problem and if possible try to fix it up. The team can help them out. On the contrary, if someone did not care at all about the issue or willingly neglected it, it is worth pointing it out and acknowledging potential consequences. 

In effect, don’t punish good behaviour.
