## Introduction
One of the most important thing in Scouts is having a strong volunteer team. Most Scouters are not  paid and are involved in the program on their own time. 

Recognition gives credit to people and is a way of thinking them for their time and service. Without recognition, people may feel that the impact they have made is limited.

The same extends to youth who go above and beyond in the program, or simply help keep the group functioning.

## Recognition
Recognition alone is not enough but it is a good step.

There are a few ways to show recognition:
* Certificates
* Verbal appreciation
* Hand clapping, thank yous
* Medals

Scout Canada offers these to Scouters:
* Scouts Canada memorabilia
* Badges
* Gift
* Gift card, presents…

Another one - asking the Youth to put something together may yield a very creative and thoughtful gift.

## Meritocracy in Relation to Awards
The more work you put in, the more you should be recognized in an ideal situation. In Scouts, there are many Scouters who go above and beyond. Good work needs to be lauded especially since people are volunteering their time away from family and not getting paid.

There’s the line, *give credit where due*. When someone puts significantly more work than someone else, they should be highlighted. At the same time, people who help out should all be recognized for putting in the time.
