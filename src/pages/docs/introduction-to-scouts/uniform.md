Important for Unity

---

## Uniform
The uniform is a way for members to be "unified".

The proper uniform can be seen below:

//insert uniform diagrams below with pdf links at the resource section

Why is it important for everyone to wear the same uniform?
The point of a uniform is for everyone to look the same and unified. There is a dress code in Scouts. When badges are not placed in the specified area, problems can arise.

As well, it should be presentable. Iron the uniform every so often.

To the right is the badge placement on the uniform → 

For OAS, only 9 are meant to be on. Whenever a new level is achieved, remove the previous one.

The top button should be buttoned. Aas well, the scarf goes above the collar.

Dress Code:
Group Scarf (typically)
Uniform
Black Belt
Tan Pants
Black Shoes

It is recommended to get the Scout Uniform from the Scout Shop and buy the other listed items at Walmart or another apparel store (if you don’t already have it). Note that the group scarf is given at the Investiture Ceremony (cannot be bought at the Scout Shop). 

Outdoor Uniform
There is special Scout Canada and 5th Unionville apparel (t-shirt/polo). At a very minimum, you must wear the Scout scarf at the events. By wearing the scarf, you are a part of Scout Canada and insurance is covered.

A uniform inspection is done at the start. If anything is missing, any extras can be used.

Woggle: If you completed the Wood Badge I training, you get a wooden-looking woogle. You can wear that instead.

Wood Badge Beads - This is given when the Scouter completes Wood Badge II. There are four beads that can be earned. 

Any Scouting medals can be worn at any ceremony (not in meetings).

Sewing Instructions
Get needle, thread
Put a long piece of thread through the needle and cut the thread after a sufficient length (Arm length usually is good). One tip for the needle is to continue cutting the end until it is smooth. Some water might help keep the end from splitting
Tie the two ends with a double overhand knot
Put the needle at the end of where you are going to start
Slowly weave

Campfire Blanket: A blanket to sew extra badges on, usually crest or patches from outings and events that would not go on the Scout uniform.

Badges
Most commonly they can be collect the following ways:
Earning Awards / badge
Buying them when travelling/stores
Gift /thank you

Badge trading at events such as the World Jamboree. The general rule is 1 to 1. Bigger badges may be more. Mutual agreement and end off with a handshake -- a transaction well done

Types of Badges

Embroidger - high quality, usually most expensive
Woven badges - cheaper but low quality











Badge Trading
National scarf
Unique shapes

Scouters want new ones from CJ badges

Activities get them 
Made their own badges (rare), need to trade

Right place, right time

Pretty badge with unique theming (E.g. a star wars badge) are liked, though the audience may be more limited.
Jamboree badges are rare. Once it is gone/the event is over, they are gone

US
Buy sets (e.g. a map). They can have many pieces from 2 upwards to 15. More is possible. These are favoured over a one-piece set. Rule Set for set

Demand and supply. In a Canadian Jamboree, international crests are favoured

Quality of Canadian stamps is not very good. The US badge is very nice with lots of stitching and detail. They also cost more generally and are rarer to find.

Older badges can age quite nicely!
